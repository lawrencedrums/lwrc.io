My first fully self-taught webapp is **live**!

Very proud of what I've created thus far, really excited to add new features and projects in the future!

Frontend built with React, Hooks, hosted on Netlify. Backend powered by Dockerized Python with the Django REST framework and PostgreSQL, hosted on Heroku. AWS S3 for hosting image files.
