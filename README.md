My first fully self-taught webapp is **live**!

### 12 Oct, 2021 update:

**The store is now open!**

The store uses the Stripe API for secure payment using credit cards. I've put up my carefully curated range of drums transcriptions for sell. Although currently only supporting single item checkout, I'm planning to implement a shopping cart and multi-checkout functionality soon.

In this project I'm using React on the frontend. It also built on sereval other technologies such as: hooks, styled-components, react-router, and axios. The frontend app is hosted on Netlify.

Backend is written in Python using the Django and Django REST framework. Using Docker as a container, the backend is hosted on Heroku connected to a Postgres datebase. Any static files uploaded to Django is saved in the AWS.

### Features to add:

1. Make responsive to mobile/large screens
2. Contact form
3. Shopping cart/multi-item checkout
4. User Login
5. Add photo
